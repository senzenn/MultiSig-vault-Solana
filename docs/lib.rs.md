# Vault Solana Program - Library Documentation (`lib.rs`)

## Overview

The `lib.rs` file serves as the main entry point and module declaration file for the Vault Solana program. This is a comprehensive DeFi vault program that provides multi-signature governance, yield farming, time-locked deposits, emergency controls, and multi-token support on the Solana blockchain.

## Program Architecture

### Program ID
```rust
solana_program::declare_id!("VAULT11111111111111111111111111111111111111");
```
**Note**: This is a placeholder program ID and should be replaced with the actual deployed program ID.

### Module Structure

The program is organized into the following modules:

#### Core Modules
- **`instruction.rs`** - Defines all instruction types and data structures for program interactions
- **`processor.rs`** - Main instruction processing logic and routing
- **`state.rs`** - Data structures representing program state and accounts
- **`events.rs`** - Event definitions for logging program activities

#### DeFi Integration Modules
- **`defi.rs`** - DeFi protocol integrations (Orca, Raydium, Saber, Jupiter)
- **`protocols.rs`** - Protocol interfaces and implementations

#### Processor Modules
Located in `processors/` directory:
- **`basic.rs`** - Core vault operations (initialize, deposit, withdraw)
- **`multisig.rs`** - Multi-signature proposal and approval system
- **`emergency.rs`** - Emergency controls and pause functionality
- **`multitoken.rs`** - Support for multiple token types
- **`timelock.rs`** - Time-locked deposits and vesting
- **`yield_farming.rs`** - Yield strategy management
- **`jupiter.rs`** - Jupiter DEX integration for token swaps
- **`fees.rs`** - Fee management and collection
- **`admin.rs`** - Administrative functions
- **`governance.rs`** - On-chain governance system

## Key Exports

### Main Types and Functions
```rust
// Instruction and state types
pub use instruction::{VaultInstruction, GovernanceInstruction, GovernanceAccountMeta, VoteType};
pub use state::*;

// DeFi protocol interfaces
pub use defi::{YieldProtocol, get_protocol, defi_protocols};

// Main processor function
pub use processor::process_instruction;
```

### Event System
```rust
// Event emission macro
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! emit_event {
    ($event:expr) => {
        msg!("EVENT: {}", serde_json::to_string(&$event).unwrap_or_else(|_| "Event serialization failed".to_string()));
    };
}
```

- Emergency withdrawal options
- Administrative override capabilities

## Event Logging

The program implements comprehensive event logging for transparency and monitoring:

- **Deposit Events** - Track token deposits with amounts and users
- **Withdrawal Events** - Track token withdrawals with amounts and users
- **Proposal Events** - Track governance proposal lifecycle
- **Vote Events** - Track voting activities
- **Emergency Events** - Track emergency actions
- **Fee Events** - Track fee collection and distribution

## Usage Flow

### 1. Vault Initialization
```rust
// Initialize vault with authority and supported tokens
VaultInstruction::Initialize { bump }
```

### 2. Multi-Signature Setup (Optional)
```rust
// Set up multi-signature requirements
VaultInstruction::InitializeMultiSig {
    authorities: vec![pubkey1, pubkey2, pubkey3],
    threshold: 2,
    bump,
}
```

### 3. Governance Setup (Optional)
```rust
// Initialize governance system
VaultInstruction::InitializeGovernance {
    voting_token_mint,
    quorum_threshold: 1000,
    proposal_threshold: 100,
    voting_period: 604800, // 7 days
    timelock_delay: 172800, // 2 days
    execution_threshold: 500,
}
```

### 4. Token Operations
```rust
// Deposit tokens
VaultInstruction::Deposit { amount }

// Withdraw tokens
VaultInstruction::Withdraw { amount }

// Add new supported token
VaultInstruction::AddSupportedToken { mint, bump }
```

### 5. Advanced Features
```rust
// Create time-locked deposit
VaultInstruction::CreateTimeLock {
    beneficiary,
    amount,
    duration: 31536000, // 1 year
    cliff_duration: Some(7776000), // 90 days
    is_linear: true,
}

// Set yield strategy
VaultInstruction::SetYieldStrategy {
    token_mint,
    strategy_program,
}

// Perform token swap via Jupiter
VaultInstruction::JupiterSwap {
    input_mint,
    output_mint,
    amount,
    slippage_bps: 50, // 0.5%
}
```

## Development Notes

### Program ID Management
Remember to update the program ID after deployment:
```rust
solana_program::declare_id!("YOUR_DEPLOYED_PROGRAM_ID");
```

### Testing Considerations
- Test all authorization paths
- Verify multi-signature functionality
- Test emergency scenarios
- Validate fee calculations
- Ensure proper event emission

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Update program ID
- [ ] Configure DeFi protocol addresses
- [ ] Set appropriate fee parameters
- [ ] Test all instruction types
- [ ] Verify event logging
- [ ] Audit security measures

## Dependencies

The program relies on several Solana ecosystem crates:
- `solana-program` - Core Solana program functionality
- `spl-token` - SPL token operations
- `spl-associated-token-account` - Associated token account management
- `borsh` - Binary serialization
- `serde` - Event serialization

This modular architecture provides a robust foundation for a comprehensive DeFi vault with enterprise-grade security features and extensive functionality.
